A React client for consuming the Tag it Bot API.
The project idea was to create a simplificated interface inspired by the Twitter and Google Keep to organize saved tweets by the bot. To display then in a intuitive and visible way, was decided to show tags, tweet's author e the content  in a "note" template, with tag filters e a pagination by date.
Most people uses Twitter on their phones so the app also has a Responsive layout with the same functionalities.

If you like the project consider following on twitter and use our bot!
